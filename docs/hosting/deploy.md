```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Reflex Hosting Service

```python eval
rx.alert(
    rx.alert_icon(),
    rx.alert_title("Hosting is in Alpha"),
    rx.alert_description("Please reach out to us on Discord if you have an app ready to deploy and if we will give you an invitation code."
    ),
    status="info",
    width="100%",
    margin_bottom="1rem",
)
```

So far, we've been running our apps locally on our own machines.
But what if we want to share our apps with the world?  This is where
deployment comes in.

## Reflex Deploy

Please follow the hosting guide here to deploy your app **(invitation code needed)**: [Reflex Hosting](https://reflex-dev.notion.site/Reflex-Hosting-Documentation-57a4dd55d6234858bbae0be75be79ce7?pvs=4)
