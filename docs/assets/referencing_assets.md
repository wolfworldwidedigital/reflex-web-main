```python exec

import reflex as rx
from pcweb.templates.docpage import docdemobox, docdemo
import inspect


def image_example():
    return rx.image(src="/Reflex.svg", width="5em")
```

# Assets

Static files such as images and stylesheets can be placed in `"assets/"` folder of the project. These files can be referenced within your app.

## Referencing Assets

To reference an image in the `"assets/"` simply pass the relative path as a prop.

For example, you can store your logo in your assets folder:
```bash
assets
└── Reflex.svg
```

Then you can display it using a `rx.image` component:

```python eval
docdemo(inspect.getsource(image_example).replace("def image_example():", "").replace("return ", ""),
    comp=image_example(),
)
```

## Favicon

The favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser tab.

You can add a `"favicon.ico"` file to the `"assets/"` folder to change the favicon.
